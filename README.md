View the [JSON server mock API](https://our-recipes-backend.herokuapp.com/recipes), deployed with Heroku, and the [backend repo](https://github.com/karen-olson/our-recipes-backend).

## Packages

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The backend for this project is hosted with [JSON Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server).

Styling was achieved using [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/).

## Startup

After installing json-server, navigate to the project repo and run ```json-server --watch db.json --port 3000```. Be sure to change the fetch request URLs to match the server you're using (ex. localhost:3000/recipes). Then, open the app in the browser by running ```npm start```.
Alternatively, see instructions for deploying the backend to a free hosting site in the [backend repo ReadMe](https://github.com/karen-olson/our-recipes-backend/blob/master/README.md).

## Sources

The recipes were gathered from www.veganheaven.org, www.joyfoodsunshine.com, www.mamaknowsglutenfree.com, and www.allrecipes.com.
