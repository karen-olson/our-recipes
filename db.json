      "instructions": [
        "In a large mixing bowl, whisk together milk, white vinegar, salt, and pepper. Add in chicken pieces. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours. It is best to allow the chicken to marinate overnight if you can.",
        "Prepare the breading by combining the gluten-free flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika, thyme, oregano, basil in a gallon-sized resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake to combine the ingredients. Or combined the ingredients in a shallow dish.",

Repeat the steps until all the chicken pieces are coated.",
        "Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time (do not overcrowd the pan). Place the breaded chicken skin side down first into the 350°F oil. Watch the temperature of the oil, as the chicken causes the oil temperature to drop. Adjust your heat as needed to keep the chicken gently cooking. Fry each piece for 15-18 minutes, turning each piece over using tongs about every 2 minutes, until the chicken is fully cooked, golden brown, and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F.",
        "Remove the chicken pieces from the oil with tongs and place them on a cooling rack or paper towel-lined baking sheet. Let the fried chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. The chicken can be served warm or cold.",
        "Store completely cooled leftovers in an air-tight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.",
        "Reheat chicken in the microwave or on a baking sheet and bake uncovered at 350°F for 15-20 minutes until the chicken is heated through."
